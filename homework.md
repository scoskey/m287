# Math 287 homework

## Week 1 (Due Tuesday, August 28 at 12pm)

1. Read the student's preface and sections 1&ndash;5 of Scheinerman. Then write a one or two paragraph response. You may use the following questons as prompts to help you think of ideas. What do we seek to achieve in mathematics? What methods do we use to achieve these goals? What is the role of logic in the development of mathematics? What are the roles of definitions, theorems, and proofs? What questions do you have?

2. Review your work from Activity 1, questions 5 and 6. Write a mathematical statement summarizing your conclusion (theorem). Then, as best as you can, write a logical explanation of why your statement is true (proof).

3. Scheinerman, exercises 3.6, 3.7  
3.6: Define what it means for an integer to be a perfect square. For example, 0,1,4,9,16, etc are perfect squares. Your definition should start with "An integer x is called a perfect square provided..."  
3.7: Define what it means for one number to be the square root of another number.

4. Scheinerman, exercises 4.4, 4.12(a)  
4.4. Consider the two statemens "If A, then B" and "(not A) or B". Under what circumstances are these statements true? When are they false? Explain why these statements are, in essence, identical.  
4.12(a). More about conjectures. What can you say about the sum of consecutive odd numbers starting with 1?  Evaluate 1, 1+3, 1+3+5, 1+3+5+7, and so on. Formulate a conjecture.

5. Scheinerman, exercise 5.1  
5.1. Prove that the sum of two odd integers is even.
