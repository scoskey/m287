Office hours: TBA

## Course description

The catalog statement:

> An introduction to formal mathematical language, mathematical experimentation, mathematical proofs, mathematical communication, and technologies supporting the above. Core content includes sets and functions, elementary number theory and induction, and distances and topology on the real line. Additional content drawn from logic, combinatorics and probability, graph theory, and modular arithmetic.

This course will largely be a successor to Math 187/189.

## Anticipated learning outcomes

* Explore mathematical definitions and evaluate mathematical statements
* Read and write mathematical proofs at an intermediate level
* Possess knowledge in content araes so as to be prepared for upper-division mathematics classes
* Use technologies to support mathematical exploration and communication

## Rough plan

* Weeks 1-3: Review of induction, sets, and functions
* Weeks 4-7: Real numbers, sequences, and topology
* Week 8: Midterm assessment
* Weeks 9-11: Number theory and algebra
* Weeks 12-14: Combinatorics and graph theory
* Weeks 15-16: Review and final assessment

## Grading

* Midterm assessment 20%
* Final assessment 20%
* Activities 10%
* Homework 40%

## Video lectures

## Activities

Some of these activities will be collected in order to provide fast feedback. A small discretionary portion of your grade will be based on preparation, attention, and collaboration during class time, and completion of in-class activities.

## Homework

Homework assignments will be given weekly. I will check your work for completeness, and spot-check certain problems for correcteness and mathematical style. You are encouraged to collaborate with your peers, you are welcome to use online resources when you are stuck. But please keep in mind that you must always fully understand your solutions and most importantly *write them in your own words*.

## Remote sessions

Each remote class session will consist partly of working on the activities as a group, and partly of discussing material and answering homework questions. Attendance is strongly encouraged.
