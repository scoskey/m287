## Course description

The course title is 'Mathematical proofs and methods' and the catalog statement reads:

> An introduction to formal mathematical language, mathematical experimentation, mathematical proofs, mathematical communication, and technologies supporting the above. Core content includes sets and functions, elementary number theory and induction, and distances and topology on the real line. Additional content drawn from logic, combinatorics and probability, graph theory, and modular arithmetic.

Math 287 is a successor to Math 187/189 and we will build on what you have learned there. The course is intended to support you in your transition to upper division, proof-based mathematics courses. I hope to help you hone your investigative powers, refine your ability to prove statements, and improve your mathematical writing style.

### Anticipated learning outcomes

* Explore mathematical definitions and evaluate mathematical statements
* Read and write mathematical proofs at an intermediate level
* Possess knowledge in content areas so as to be prepared for upper-division mathematics classes
* Use technologies to support mathematical exploration and communication

### Rough plan

* Weeks 1-3: Review of induction, sets, and functions
* Weeks 4-7: Number theory and algebra
* Week 8: Midterm assessment
* Weeks 9-11: Combinatorics and graph theory
* Weeks 12-14: Real numbers, sequences, and topology
* Weeks 15-16: Review and final assessment

### Course format

Materials for each week will be posted shortly before the week begins (though some items may appear at the beginning of the week too). The materials will typically include reading assignments, video lectures, an activity assignment, and a graded homework assignment.

Remote class sessions will be held every Monday and Wednesday. During these sessions we will work together to explore and learn from the week's activity, and then interactively discuss the material and homework. The two class sessions will therefore be similar, and I strongly encourage you attend at least one of these sessions.

## Grading

Your grade will be based on three areas.

### Activities 10%

To earn points for activities, you must either participate actively in the remote session, or turn in your completed activity via Gradescope. I may collect and give feedback on some activities. Please keep your completed activities in a notebook.

### Homework 50%

I will collect homework assignments weekly via Gradescope. I will check your work for completeness, and spot-grade certain problems for both correcteness and mathematical style. You are encouraged to collaborate with your peers, you are welcome to use online resources when you are stuck. But please keep in mind that you must always fully understand your solutions and most importantly *write them in your own words*.

### Assessments 20% x2

Assessments will occur during the 8th week and finals week of the class. The majority of each assessment will consist of a take-home exam. I may supplement the assessments with a live remote component.

## Disclaimer

This syllabus is subject to change. I may make refinements and updates in the first week of classes. While I don't expect any substantial changes, due to the unpredictable conditions of this semester, please allow for some flexibility. I will give notice before making any changes to the syllabus.
