# Math 287, Fall 2020

## Course information

Meeting times: M,W from 1:30&ndash;2:40pm  
Textbook: Edward Scheinerman, *Mathematics: a discrete introduction*, 3rd edition (recommended)  
Homework: [Weekly assignments](homework)  
Contact: `scoskey@boisestate.edu`  
Office hours: TBA

## Course description

The course title is 'Mathematical proofs and methods' and the catalog statement reads:

> An introduction to formal mathematical language, mathematical experimentation, mathematical proofs, mathematical communication, and technologies supporting the above. Core content includes sets and functions, elementary number theory and induction, and distances and topology on the real line. Additional content drawn from logic, combinatorics and probability, graph theory, and modular arithmetic.

Math 287 is a successor to Math 187/189 and we will build on what you have learned there.

## Anticipated learning outcomes

* Explore mathematical definitions and evaluate mathematical statements
* Read and write mathematical proofs at an intermediate level
* Possess knowledge in content araes so as to be prepared for upper-division mathematics classes
* Use technologies to support mathematical exploration and communication

## Rough plan

* Weeks 1-3: Review of induction, sets, and functions
* Weeks 4-7: Number theory and algebra
* Week 8: Midterm assessment
* Weeks 9-11: Combinatorics and graph theory
* Weeks 12-14: Real numbers, sequences, and topology
* Weeks 15-16: Review and final assessment

## Grading

* Midterm assessment 20%
* Final assessment 20%
* Activities 20%
* Weekly homework and other assignments 40%

## Course format

At the end of each week I will post materials for the following week (though some may follow later). This will typically include reading assignments, video lectures, an activity assignment, and a homework assignment. Please complete the reading and lectures before attending a remote class session on Monday or Wednesday. Each remote session will consist partly of active exploration using the activity, and partly of discussing material and answering homework questions. Attendance is strongly encouraged.

I will collect some activities to give quick feedback, while others will be graded on a completion basis only. You can earn points for completing the activity by attending remote sessions and participating actively, or by turning in your activity at a later collection date. Please keep your completed activities in a notebook.

I will collect homework assignments weekly. I will check your work for completeness, and spot-check certain problems for correcteness and mathematical style. You are encouraged to collaborate with your peers, you are welcome to use online resources when you are stuck. But please keep in mind that you must always fully understand your solutions and most importantly *write them in your own words*.
